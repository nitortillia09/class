Graduation Requirements: Students normally take five or six courses each year. At least four of these courses must be from the liberal arts disciplines of English, Mathematics, Science, History, and Modern & Classical language. Five is strongly recommended. Each year, students meet with their advisors to choose courses for the following academic year. Students will receive recommendations from classroom teachers for suggestions about the best fit course (s) to take the following year. Students also choose electives and other academic courses not required for graduation. Freshman course placements are determined by criteria set by respective divisions. Course verification sheets are sent home each spring to ensure accuracy. The master schedule is created based on student selection of courses.
